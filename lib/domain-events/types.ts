/**
 * Stable, versioned contracts for Trellis domain events.
 *
 * A "domain event" is any message that crosses a boundary inside the app:
 * a `window` `CustomEvent`, a cross-tab `BroadcastChannel` message, or a
 * message handed to a service worker. The problem this module solves is that
 * those boundaries used to be typed by convention only — a string literal plus
 * an inline object literal — so a producer could rename a field, drop a field,
 * or change a type and no compiler, test, or consumer would notice until
 * runtime.
 *
 * The contract is a two-layer schema:
 *
 *   1. {@link EventEnvelopeSchema} - the frame every event shares. It is
 *      validated with `.strict()`, so a producer cannot smuggle in an
 *      undeclared top-level field.
 *   2. A per-event payload schema, registered against a semver version in
 *      `registry.ts`. These are deliberately *not* strict, which is what makes
 *      an additive minor version safe for an old consumer.
 *
 * Every published envelope carries an explicit `version`, so a consumer never
 * has to guess which payload shape it is holding.
 */
