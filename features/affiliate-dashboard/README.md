## Usage

### Basic Implementation

```tsx
import AffiliateDashboardPage from '@/features/affiliate-dashboard/page';

// In your app router
// app/affiliates/page.tsx
export default function AffiliatesPage() {
  return <AffiliateDashboardPage />;
}
```

### Using the Hook

```tsx
import { useAffiliateData } from '@/features/affiliate-dashboard/hooks/useAffiliateData';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const walletAddress = 'GXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX';
  const {
    stats,
    referrals,
    commissionBreakdown,
    payoutRequests,
    isLoading,
    error,
    requestPayout,
    generateReferralCode,
  } = useAffiliateData(walletAddress);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Total Earnings: {stats?.totalEarnings} XLM</h1>
      <button onClick={() => generateReferralCode()}>
        Generate Code
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Using the Store Directly

```tsx
import { useAffiliateStore } from '@/features/affiliate-dashboard/store/useAffiliateStore';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { stats, fetchAffiliateData, requestPayout } = useAffiliateStore();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Pending Earnings: {stats?.pendingEarnings} XLM</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### Commission Structure
The default commission structure is:
- **Direct**: 10% of referred user's trading volume
- **Tier 2**: 5% from users referred by your referrals
- **Tier 3**: 2% from users referred by tier 2 referrals

### Payout Settings
- **Minimum Payout**: 100 XLM
- **Payout Frequency**: Weekly
- **Processing Time**: 1-2 business days

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Stellar wallet-based authentication (Freighter, Albedo, Ledger)
- Session recovery from localStorage
- Multi-wallet support with delegation

### Data Protection
- All API calls include wallet address validation
- Stellar address format validation (56 chars, starts with G)
- Amount validation and minimum payout enforcement
- Transaction hash tracking for audit trail

### Best Practices
- Never expose private keys
- Validate all user inputs on frontend and backend
- Implement rate limiting on payout requests
- Log all affiliate activities for compliance
- Regular security audits of commission calculations

## Performance Optimizations

- React Query for server state caching (30s stale time)
- Zustand for efficient client state management
- Lazy loading of chart components
- Memoized calculations for commission breakdowns
- Debounced search and filter operations
- Efficient table rendering with virtualization support

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Stellar wallet extensions (Freighter, Albedo, Ledger)
- Canvas API for chart rendering
- LocalStorage for session persistence

## Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test -- features/affiliate-dashboard
```
